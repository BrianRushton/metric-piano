# metric-piano
Piano keyboard with 10 half-steps per octave (now "septave"!) instead of 12

## Explanation
The musical scale used by just about everything is divided into octaves, each of which contains 12 "half-steps". On a piano, some are white and some are black, but the intervals are all 2^(1/12) times the one below it, so that each note has a frequency of twice that of the one an octave below.

One might ask how we decided on 12 half-steps. I don't know (although it seems there are some handy math reasons), but I wondered what would happen if we only used 10. You know, like the metric system! This project is an investigation into that question. My hypothesis is that everything will sound... just terrible. This might be an absolute abomination.

## How to Use
If you download this project, you can just double click piano.html to open the piano in your browser. (It isn't currently published to the web.)
